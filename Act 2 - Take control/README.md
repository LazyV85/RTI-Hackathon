# Take Control

## Backstory
Fabrikam's immediate requirement is to control the spread of bad reputation through defective production and shipping these defective products to their customers. For this, they need your help to work on previously gathered data and make actionable insights available to all the management and operational teams.

## Setup
For running this Act, 
1. You will need knowledge of Kusto Query Language (KQL).
2. You will need to access to create a Fabric Activator and Real-Time Dashboard.

## Challenges 

## 1. Get Latest Shipping details
<details>
<summary>Hint!</summary>

Use update policy to parse xml into silver table

Use Materialized View to get latest status details for each OrderNumber

</details>

## 2. Stop the shipping providers  and production line that is carrying the highest defect probability product for every 1 hour
<details>
<summary>Hint!</summary>

Use a combination of the following steps to achieve this

1. Join between product, operators, shipment, shipping provider, and production

2. Create 1 Alert to stop shipping provider with details of OrderNumber, ProductName, ShippingProvider, PhoneNumber of the provider, HQaddress

3. Create one more Alert to stop production line with details of ProductId, ProductName, OperatorId, OperatorName, PhoneNumber of the operator, AssetId, BatchId

4. Activator limiting to 5 details? Try combining ProductId, ProductName and OperatorId, Operatorname in KQL query into one column Ex: [OperatorId - OperatorName]

</details>

## 3. Create an operational dashboard for Fabrikam management
1. Show  all operators details.
2. Correlation between defective and non-defective products in 1 hour bins
4. Current shipment status (count of orders by status). 
5. Map showing shipment count by destination

<details>
<summary>Hint!</summary>

Use copilot dashboard creation from Real-Time Hub

Use the anomaly flag column you defined in the SQL Code Operator before, to see the defection & non-defective products and use that in a line chart
</details>

* Below is just an example of an operational dashboard for Fabrikam management, feel free to make this realtime dashboard your own.
